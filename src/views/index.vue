                         - Parents often have very high academic and career expectations for their children, which some children cannot live up to. Unfortunately, in some societies, concern about disappointing one's parents is a tragedy the student cannot deal with, so he kills himself.

                          <h4 style="text-align:center">CHILDREN'S INTERESTS</h4>
                          <hr style="background-color:#fff; width:5em;">
                          - This is not an uncommon situation. A child has a field of study that he is interested in, but the parent has a totally different goal for him. The child wants to be an artist; his parents want him to go to med-school and become a doctor. The child wants to be a political scientist; his parents want him to be an engineer. This clash is very deadly to the child inbuilt passion.

                    - From the two previous writing, it can be read clearly that the parent and children themselves have a lot to do in determination of a brighter and better future ahead, for this singular reason we at Eduplus have come up with an educative system which would not only guide the young minds but also set some basic tools in order for them to easily and conveniently determine which skill or course of study to pursue
